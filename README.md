This repository demonstrates an uncommon Python bug related to improper exception handling and data type issues. The `bug.py` file contains code that simulates a scenario where a KeyError or TypeError exception could occur due to missing or unexpected data types.  The `bugSolution.py` provides an improved solution focusing on robust error handling and clear logging, showing how to handle exceptions more gracefully and prevent unexpected behavior.
